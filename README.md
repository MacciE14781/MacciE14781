🌿 Hey there! I’m Maccie or call me Müller.

I’m an intermediate coder wandering through the worlds of Java, Python, and a sprinkle of C++. Right now, I’m especially pouring more time into learning Java — slowly, warmly, and patiently building up my skills, one thoughtful step at a time. ☕💻✨

For me, coding feels a bit like curling up with a good book and a mug of coffee: it’s comforting, a little challenging, and always full of little surprises that spark curiosity. Every new method or pattern I learn feels like adding another soft patch to my growing quilt of knowledge. 🍁🧵

Even though I’m still on my path to becoming truly fluent, I love exploring, tinkering, and making small cozy tools — just to see what gentle magic can come out of it.

Beyond the code, I’m someone who enjoys the quiet side of life: peaceful evenings, soft corners, and keeping things clear, kind, and maybe a little charming.

So that’s me, Maccie: a coffee-loving coder, always learning, always cozy, and hoping to bring a bit of warmth and curiosity to everything I build. 🌼🧡
